# sorting_visualizer
This is a command-line interface (CLI) sorting visualizer written in Rust using the tui-rs library. It allows you to visualize the sorting algorithms in action, providing a better understanding of how these algorithms work. This project is a personal endeavor, created to experiment and explore Rust programming language.
